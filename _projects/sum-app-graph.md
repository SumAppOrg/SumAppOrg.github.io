## Challenge
***“Without Data Standards, the Industries Don’t Go Digital”***

* *…have been notoriously slow to adopt digital transformation*
  - Logical data model and schema for industry-related data elements
  - Standards for process and decision modeling, Definition of customer specific new, more flexible processes.
* *…created by subject matter experts – not programmers*
  - Executable Process Design without Programming
  - Builds on / extends third party components by programmers as reusable package

## Market
***“Reviews for Enterprise Low-Code Application Platforms (LCAP) Market”***

* *…projected to grow from USD 13.2 billion in 2020 to USD 45.5 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 28.1%*
  - Google Cloud launches its Business Application Platform based on AppSheet.
  - Siemens closes Mendix acquisition, extending industry leading digital innovation platform.
* *…competition is moving swiftly*
  - Application Express (APEX) *by Oracle*
  - Salesforce Lightning Platform *by Salesforce*
  - Zoho Creator *by Zoho*
  - Power Apps *by Microsoft*

***“Industry segments”***

* *…Aerospace & Defense*
  - Identifying, characterizing and remediating the points of friction in the flow of product information across locations, collaboration entities and between applications during product development.
* *…Chemicals Pharmaceuticals & FMCG*
  - Standards based data exchange and compliance. Collaboration needs for supplier, ingredient and facility qualification.
* *…Automotive*
  - Globally distributed matrix of suppliers and partners develop products with a wide range of applications and processes.
* *…Construction & Real Estate*
  - Africa and South East Asia construction market still looking for a effective collaborative solution based on their compliance

## The Idea
***“A platform that allows domain experts in organizations to model the business in a visual environment. The platform then allows them to expose the models in business applications without having to write programs.”***

## Summary
***“Support customers build a shared understanding of business knowledge”***

* …visual modeling tool to help customers set up business entities and their relationships, define business rules.
* …business and IT users can jointly specify business entities they commonly use along with their exact definition. The resulting semantically rich business language is consumed in channel software applications (Mobile, Desktop, Web, IIoT and Blockchain)
* …enables technical resources to encapsulate programmatic logic and lets non-technical domain experts assemble the business logic to innovate, transform and improve their business
